I was delighted to take part in **Copernicus Marine Essentials**, a series of three webinars organized by the Copernicus Marine team. This 3-day event was a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge on how to explore, access, and use marine data.

For those who couldn’t attend, the **recordings**, **post-event report**, and **PDF presentations** from the speakers are available. I’d also like to share the link to the **complete online tutorial series from this workshop**:
